/*
 * The key to this problem is the fact that numbers in chains will always be revisted
 * when examining other numbers and there's no point in re-treading a chain that's already been looked at.
 * 
 * For example, the chain starting with 2 goes 2 -> 4 -> 16 -> 7 -> 49 -> 97 -> 130 -> 10 -> 1
 * So when examining the chain that starts with 2, we can simply take note of the fact that it and all the numbers
 * in its chain will converge on 1.
